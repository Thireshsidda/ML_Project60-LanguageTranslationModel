# Language Translation Model with TensorFlow

## Overview
This project aims to build a language translation model using TensorFlow, specifically focusing on sequence-to-sequence models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of stop words in 28 different languages. Each language has its own text file containing a list of stop words.

## Code Structure
### 1. Package Imports
- Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and pandas.
- Enable eager execution in TensorFlow.

### 2. Data Processing
- Read the text data from the provided files and decode it.
- Convert characters to integers for model training.
- Define sequence length and prepare the dataset for training.

### 3. Model Architecture
- Define the architecture of the RNN-based language translation model.
- Set parameters such as batch size, embedding dimension, and number of RNN units.
- Use CuDNN GRU layers for efficient training.

### 4. Training the Model
- Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
- Define a custom loss function for sparse categorical cross-entropy.
- Train the model using the prepared dataset.
- Save checkpoints during training for future use.

### 5. Generating Text
- Load the trained model weights from the checkpoints.
- Define a starting string for text generation.
- Generate text using the trained model by predicting the next characters.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset containing stop words in multiple languages is available.
2. **Model Training**: Run the provided code to train the language translation model.
3. **Text Generation**: Use the trained model to generate text in the desired language.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pandas

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different RNN architectures (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for better performance.
- Explore attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy, especially for longer sequences.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size for optimal results.

## Acknowledgments
- Acknowledge any additional resources, libraries, or datasets used in the project.
